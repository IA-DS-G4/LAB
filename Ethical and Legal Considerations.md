# Ethical and Legal Considerations for Lung Mass Classification using CT Images

## Possible Ethical and Legal implications

### Group 1: Team and Project Management

•	Employee Comfort: Ensure that all team members are comfortable with the goals of the project, especially those related to handling medical cases.
•	Ethical Precautions: Clarify ethical issues surronding the handling of sensitive patient data.
•	Fair Work Distribution: Effectively distribute responsibilities among team members.
•	Proper Work Conditions: Provide suitable conditions for the successful execution of the project.
•	Originality: Emphasize how innovative the proposed model is.

### Group 2: Bias and Potential Harm
•	Research Bias: Address and mitigate any biases that may impact the classification results based on ethnicity, gender, or other factors.
•	External Pressures: Be alert to external pressures that could compromise the accuracy and objectivity of the results.
•	Potential Harm: Identify the potential consequences of misclassification and take steps to minimize harm.

### Group 3: Involvement of Human Data
•	Human or Personal Data: Acknowledge that the project involves sensitive patient information.
•	Data Limitation: Collect only minimal sensitive information to ensure patient privacy and data protection.
•	Anonymity: Implement measures to ensure the anonymity of the patients whose data is used.
•	Data Confidentiality: Ensure that data is handled confidentially, securely, and in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
•	Data Deletion: Define clear processes for data deletion when it is no longer needed, respecting patients' right to be forgotten.

### Group 4: Involvement of AI Systems
•	Autonomous Systems and AI: Clarify that the project uses AI systems for lung mass classification.
•	User Control: Ensure that users (medical professionals) have control over the AI system's predictions and can override or validate its recommendations.
•	Explanation and Reproducibility: Make sure that the AI model provides explanations for its predictions, improving transparency and trust.
•	Security and Backdoors: Establish robust security measures to protect the AI system from breaches or vulnerabilities.
•	Monitoring Unexpected Results: Continuously monitor the AI system for unexpected or irrational results and have mechanisms for corrective action.


## Current and future regulation issues

### Regulatory Compliance:
•	Medical Regulations: Ensure compliance with relevant medical regulations, such as those from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), when applying AI to medical diagnosis.
•	Data Protection Laws: Adhere to data protection laws to safeguard patient information.
•	Ethical Guidelines: Follow ethical guidelines set by medical and AI professional bodies to ensure responsible research and application.

### Future Regulation Issues:
•	AI-Specific Regulations: Be prepared to adapt to future AI-specific regulations that may impact medical AI systems' development and deployment. For instance, the world's first major summit on artificial intelligence (AI) safety took place on November 1st and 2nd.
