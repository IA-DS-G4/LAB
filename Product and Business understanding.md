# Product and Business understanding


## Product understanding

*	**Healthcare Professionals**: Our project primarily serves healthcare professionals, including radiologists, oncologists, and medical practitioners. It addresses their pressing need for accurate and timely information to diagnose and treat patients with potential lung masses. By automating and enhancing the classification of lung masses, we aim to significantly reduce the amount of time and resources needed for diagnosis. This means quicker results and more efficient allocation of healthcare resources.
  
*	**Patient Perspective**: It's crucial to highlight how the project benefits patients. Timely and precise identification of malignant or benign lung masses can lead to better treatment outcomes, reduced stress, and improved quality of life.
  
*	**Diagnostic Accuracy**: The project significantly contributes to improving the diagnostic accuracy in lung cancer detection. By leveraging AI and CT image analysis, it offers a tool that can assist medical professionals in making better informed decisions.
  
*	**Early Detection**: Early detection of lung cancer is a key need in healthcare. Our project's predictive model can potentially identify malignant lung masses in their early stages, allowing for more effective and less invasive treatment options.
  
*	**Reduced Misdiagnosis**: this project addresses the challenge of misdiagnosis. By minimizing the risk of false positives and false negatives, it reduces the psychological and financial burden on both patients and the healthcare system.


## Business understanding

*	**Business Purpose**: Our project is more than just a technical endeavor; it aligns perfectly with the core purpose of the healthcare industry. We strive to elevate patient care by improving diagnostic accuracy. This not only leads to better treatment strategies but also contributes to cost-efficiency within the healthcare system. Effective resource allocation is another crucial business objective. By assisting healthcare professionals in prioritizing patients who require immediate attention, we ensure that limited healthcare resources are directed where they are needed most.

*	**Applicability**: One of the fundamental strengths of our project is its practical applicability. We understand the importance of seamless integration into existing healthcare systems. Our solution is designed to work harmoniously with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Radiology Information Systems (RIS), making it an invaluable part of daily clinical routines. We've carefully considered the clinical workflow, ensuring that our solution enhances, rather than disrupts, the daily routines of healthcare professionals. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive features, we make it easy for medical experts to incorporate our solution into their practice.

*	**Impact**: The impact of our project is multifaceted. At its core, it's about improving patient outcomes. Accurate lung mass classification results in timely treatments, increased survival rates, and ultimately, a positive impact on the lives of those affected by lung cancer. Cost-efficiency is not just a buzzword for us; it's a tangible benefit. Our project contributes to cost savings by reducing unnecessary procedures and the economic burden associated with misdiagnoses. Furthermore, our data collection has the potential to drive medical research forward. It's not just about solving today's problems; it's also about contributing to the advancement of lung cancer treatment and diagnosis. The data we generate will be a valuable resource for ongoing research efforts.
