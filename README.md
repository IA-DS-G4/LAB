Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
Project 1 - Lung Cancer Classification using Computerized Tomography (CT) Data


Introduction:
The objective of the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (Lab AI & DC) course
is to provide students with software development methodologies, AI and DC projects, teamwork and
communication through the implementation of projects designed for this purpose. Students should
apply the knowledge obtained from the courses from previous years and research methodologies to
solve the problem.
In this first project, the students will use images as input data, namely Computerized Tomography
(CT) data, from the human torso, for Lung Cancer classification.


Work to do:
• You should prepare a Data Science-based solution to solve the problem proposed: Lung Cancer
Classification using Computerized Tomography (CT) Data.
• You should share your solution in a gitlab/github (share the link in moodle by the second practical
class: week of 25th of September);
• The solution should be delivered in moodle by October 22, 2023, at 23:59:59;
• Students must present their work during the practical class in the week of 23rd of October, 2023.


Submission of the solution:
• Final code solution, as a notebook;
  – you should document your notebook, explaining your decisions and discussion about the
  results obtained;
• Link for a video summary. This is a team video, but each member should participate in it. This
is a very short and to-the-point video (maximum of 5 minutes), summarizing the following:
  – the problem;
  – your solution;
  – the results and the impact you think this has.
• One-page document, including possible ethical and legal implications and the framework for
current and future regulation issues.
• Auto-evaluation file provided by Professors.


Guidelines for the solution:
• Assessed data quality and the need for data cleaning. If necessary perform cleaning of the data
relevant to the model;
• Perform data pre-processing steps (e.g. range of values (Hounsfield unit 5
, 2D vs 3D solution);
• Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis);
• Performs Feature Engineering (e.g. Radiomics 6
, Deep Features) and Selection;
• Discusses model/algorithm and technique selection, as well as model/algorithm optimization;
• Chooses performance metrics and performs validation;
• Explores model interpretability and fairness;
• Performs visualization of results;
• Why not consider other datasets to improve the generalization of the model?;
• Shows good programming skills (best practices, code commenting, performance, speed).

Some inspiration can be found in the work of Lee et. al. [LG18]. You can use a CRISP-DM-based
methodology or other to develop your solution 7


Evaluation Criteria:
Your work will be evaluated on the following criteria:
• 15% Product: understanding the needs of the end-user and if your proposal solves that problem;
• 20% Business: understanding if the solution serves the business purpose, its applicability and
impact;
• 40% Technical Skills: overall technical evaluation of the solution from a data science point-ofview;
• 15% Soft-Skills: essentially - your communication skills;
• 10% Ethical and Legal Considerations: understand if you understand it for this specific area of
application.

Some Tips:
Be creative in your solution! Think of how you can use certain approaches in an unusual way for
example.
• Consider business constraints: understand the challenge well and identify any business constraints
regarding this challenge;
• Mention the constraints you are considering for the solution in the notebook;
• Work as a team: The time is very short, our suggestion is that you distribute tasks well amongst
the team;
