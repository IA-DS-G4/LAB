# Introduction

* Lung cancer is big a concern of the global health, holding a top position in cancer-related mortality statistics, as shown in recente reports [World Health Organization, 2018; American Cancer Society, 2019]. 
* Several factors contribute to the crescent prevalence of lung cancer, including tobacco use, environmental carcinogens, and genetic predisposition. It is crucial to address these underlying causes to mitigate the increasing incidence of this devastating disease.
* It is overwelming that statistics reveals that only 16% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed as local-stage tumors, with a five-year survival rate exceeding 50%. However, when the diagnosis arrives in the advanced stages, the chances are reduced to a mere 5%. In this context, the urgency of achieving earlier diagnoses cannot be overstated, as it holds the key to elevating the survival rate among patients.
* In the battle against lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) scans play a pivotal role in its detection. CT scans, a non-invasive imaging method, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in providing essential insights into the status of lung tumors. These scans present an opportunity for the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, which can automatically assess the malignancy risk of lung nodules. By offering clinical decision support, these systems hold immense promise in the quest for earlier diagnoses, potentially turning the odds in favor of the patients.
